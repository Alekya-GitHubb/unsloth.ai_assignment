🧠 LLM Fine-Tuning Experiments with Unsloth

This repository demonstrates multiple end-to-end fine-tuning techniques for open-weights Large Language Models (LLMs) using the Unsloth
 framework.
The experiments progressively explore full fine-tuning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA), reinforcement learning, and continued pre-training, each implemented and demonstrated via Google Colab notebooks.

🧩 Colab 1 – Full Fine-Tuning with Smollm2

Notebook: Colab1-Full_Finetuning.ipynb
Objective: Perform full fine-tuning on a small model (smollm2-135M) using open-weights LLM modules.

🔍 Highlights

Uses Unsloth BnB-4bit adapter (unsloth/gemma-3-1b-it-unsloth-bnb-4bit).

Demonstrates complete gradient updates (not LoRA-based).

Defines input format, tokenizer, and dataset structure.

Fine-tunes on a chosen chat or coding dataset.

Explains hyperparameters, training flow, and evaluation.

⚙️ Colab 2 – LoRA Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning

Notebook: colab2-lora_parameter-efficient-fine-tuning.ipynb
Objective: Reuse the same model and dataset as Colab 1 but apply Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

🔍 Highlights

Converts full fine-tuning to adapter-based (train fewer parameters).

Ideal for resource-limited training setups (Colab T4/A100).

Keeps the base model frozen while training lightweight adapter matrices.

Demonstrates LoRA configuration (r, alpha, dropout).

🎯 Colab 3 – Reinforcement Learning (RLHF Setup)

Notebook: colab3_Reinforcement_learning.ipynb
Objective: Implement reinforcement learning on top of a fine-tuned LLM using preference datasets.

🔍 Highlights

Demonstrates reward-based training with preferred vs rejected responses.

Builds a basic Reward Model + Policy Model structure.

Shows how feedback loops refine generative behavior.

Explains PPO-like reward mechanisms conceptually.

🤖 Colab 4 – Reinforcement Learning with GRPO (Reasoning-Enhanced)

Notebook: colab4-reinformcement-learning-with-grpo.ipynb
Objective: Extend reinforcement learning using GRPO (Guided Reinforcement for Prompt Optimization) for reasoning datasets.

🔍 Highlights

Uses problem–solution pairs as datasets.

Rewards reasoning-driven answers rather than memorization.

Implements Unsloth GRPO utilities for efficient tuning.

Illustrates model reasoning chain improvements.

📚 Colab 5 – Continued Pre-Training (Domain Adaptation)

Notebook: colab5-Continued-pretraining.ipynb
Objective: Perform continued pre-training to teach an existing LLM new language or domain knowledge.

🔍 Highlights

Starts from a checkpoint of previously fine-tuned weights.

Uses unsupervised corpus for incremental learning.

Demonstrates Unsloth-based continued pre-training APIs.

Can be used to make a model learn a new language, domain, or style.

🧠 Additional Notes

You can continue fine-tuning from custom checkpoints generated by earlier notebooks.

All notebooks demonstrate smooth Colab execution flow (no re-initialization conflicts).
